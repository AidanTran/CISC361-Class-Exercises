When changing the values of num producer and num comsumer, it does not work as expected.
If the number of producers and consumers is equal, then it works as expected.
But if either value is zero, or the they're not equal. then the program will get stuck waiting 
on a semaphore that will never be signaled.

The program expects each producer and each consumer to produce/consume 10 items.
If the expected number of items are not equal, then the program will 
fill up or empty the queue (depending on which one has more), and then wait forever on 
its respective semaphore.

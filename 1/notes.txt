When the number needed to be summed was smaller, 100000000:
both the multithreaded (2threads) and single threaded took roughly the same time. 0.16 seconds.
If we increased the number of threads of multithread, say to 10 threads, the time increases to .25 seconds.

WHen the number summed was larger, 500000000 (5x the previous):
both the 2-threaded, and the single threaded program time and the increased to .8 seconds.
Adding more threads to the multithreaded version only made it slower. 

I was bounded by the size of memory allocated to the large array, so I couldn't go larger than 500000000,
but I imagine if I could allocate an array of larger size it would start to become more efficient.

It could also be limited by the rate at which the operating system can retrieve data from the massive array over and over again.

7. Since this simulation does not include costs due to context switching, we avoid a significant downside of the round robin scheduler.
From my testing it seems that on average is able to achieve a lower average turnaround time due to be able to avoid the convoy affect.

8. Since FCFS is completely dependent on the arrival time of the processes, it varies in performance much more than the round_robin_algorithm.
But if the shorter processes arrive before the longer ones, then FCFS has better wait time and turnaround time. 
If there is long processes followed by multiple short processes, round robin will have lower average wait and turnaround time.
Generally speaking, round robin performs better with dynamic loads, 
and fcfs will perform better with well-balanced loads.

9. If all processes have burst times shorter than the time quantum, then round robin degrades into FCFS. 
To fix this, try simulating the round robin algorithm with lower values of time_quantum, and choose the one that
gives the best turnaround time for your processes.
